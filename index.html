        //* Player 1 chooses a random letter...and has 9 instances to either win or loose.

        //* If player 1 chooses a letter that matches the computer, player 1 wins a "set"

        //* When player 1 wins a set he advances +1 on the win column

        //* If play 1 attempts 9 instances and does NOT match the computer, player 1 looses and advances +1 on the loss column

        //* When the player gets to either 8 wins or 8 looses the games is over and is reset to zero
